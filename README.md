# photoTagApp

This is the prototype of one of my course projects done on Software Development. 

This is a application that enables users to tag their photos and move them in their file system. Users can have a history log of all the changes as well.

This app is still **under development**. The planned improvement are :

* Adding more features to the app
* Improving GUI of the app
